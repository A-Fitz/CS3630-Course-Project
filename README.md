**Repository/Project Rules**
1. Check the files you are staging to add. The .svnignore file should stop any bad files from ending up in the remote repository, but check first.
2. Commit messages should start with some variation of "[JIRA-TASK-ID]" if they are applicable to a Jira task.
3. Don't push broken code to the master branch.
